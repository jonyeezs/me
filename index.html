                <h3>2015 - current</h3>
                <h4 aria-label="Position">Senior Developer</h4>
                <div aria-label="Company">Globalx Pty Ltd</div>
                <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <div>Increase effiency by "botting" some areas of the developer's work</div>
                            <div>
                                <p>Started a chatbot on Hipchat to help deploy on Octopus (CI/CD). Minimize a 3-step process to a 1-step process. As well the chatbot was able to notify development services that were flaky and allow commands for restart.</p>
                                <p>Created a CLI that helped scaffold the developer's local environment (on Kong).</p>
                            </div>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <div>Increase the teams overall skills in Angular</div>
                            <div>
                                <p>Encouraged and introduce better code structure (eg: feature module structure), advance toolings (eg: reactive forms), and help coach team members.</p>
                                <p>It was encouraging to see everyone improving and growing in confidence on understanding the framework after informal coaching sessions with teams and individuals.</p>

                        </li>

                <h4 aria-label="Position">Developer/Technical Consultant</h4>
                <div aria-label="Company">Insight Informatics Pty Ltd</div>
                <div>

                            <div>
                                <p>New clients were calling in too many times on support issues. I understood what knowledge were lacking; and revised the training material to focus on their needs.</p>
                                <p>Improvements were noticed with less support calls and better feedback from client's technical staff.</p>
                            </div>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <div>Helped paved the way for mobile presence</div>
                            <div>
                                <p>Spearheaded the project to modernize the RPC SOAP API to a minimal REST JSON API, which allowed clients to integrate better. It was a massive undertaking with changes in implementation and documentation on a system that could not have supported it at that time.</p>
                                <p>Led and self-managed the deployment of our first mobile App from design to publishing (using Cordova and BackboneJS). First beta version was out in 2 weeks.</p>

                                <p>Instead of going to a physical digital signage situated around the city to upload news, images, and videos, I came up with a solution to automate content delivery via pull notification.</p>

                        </li>

                            <div>
                                <p>I was able to comprehend Client's requirements and made queries that allow for quick feedback and clarification.</p>
                                <p>End result was an application (using VB) that ticked the boxes and, suprisingly, went straight into production usage.</p>
